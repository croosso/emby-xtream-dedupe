"""End-to-end test for repair-id-churn.py against a synthetic churn event.

Builds a config XML, a pre-event snapshot, and a post-event catalogue in a temp dir,
then drives the real script with only the HTTP fetch stubbed. The cases that matter are
the ones where a repair must NOT happen: a title that genuinely left the catalogue, and
a title the user has since reviewed and deliberately kept.

Run: python3 scripts/test-repair-id-churn.py
