"""Re-point exclusions and reviewed-checkpoints after the provider reassigns IDs.

The plugin stores decisions as bare provider IDs. When a source is re-ingested those IDs
are reassigned in bulk, and every reassigned ID silently detaches its decision: the title
returns un-excluded and unreviewed, with nothing in any log to explain it. Recovering by
hand means re-reviewing thousands of titles.

This does it mechanically. Given a snapshot taken *before* the event (see
``catalogue-snapshot.py``), it resolves each dead ID back to the title it referred to,
finds that title's new ID in the current catalogue, and proposes adding it to the same
store. Movies resolve on TMDB ID, which survives renames; series have no TMDB ID on the
list payload, so they resolve on name — the same fidelity the de-dup view's own grouping
uses.

DRY RUN BY DEFAULT. It never touches the live config. ``--write`` emits a *candidate* XML
to a path you choose, for you to diff and install yourself:

    docker stop emby
    cp candidate.xml /path/to/emby/config/plugins/configurations/<name>.xml
    # If the records root holds decisions.json, move it aside too — since ADR-F010 that file,
    # not the config, is the authoritative copy of these id lists (the script prints the path).
    docker start emby

Emby holds the config in memory and rewrites the file on its next save, so it must be
stopped for a hand-installed config to survive.

WHAT THIS NEEDS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT
  It reads the *live* config, not a backup. That works because dead ids are never pruned:
  the config still records which ids you decided about, and the snapshot supplies the only
  missing piece — which title each id used to be. A config backup is not required.

  A backup is not redundant, though: it answers a different failure. Renumbering leaves the
  ids in the config (this script's case). A config *wipe* removes them, and then no snapshot
  can help — only a backup can.

  ORDER MATTERS: never bulk-prune dead ids before running this. Pruning deletes exactly the
  ids this re-points, and the recovery goes with them. Repair first; `--prune-resolved`
  then prunes the ones it successfully re-pointed, in the same pass.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/repair-id-churn.py --snapshot /out/catalogue-ids-2026-08-26.tsv \\
      [--write /out/candidate.xml] [--additions /out/additions.txt] \\
      [--tmdb-only] [--prune-resolved]

On the NAS:
  docker run --rm --network container:emby --memory=512m --cpus=1 \\
    -v /path/to/emby/config:/cfg:ro \\
    -v "$HOME/xtream-snapshots":/out \\
