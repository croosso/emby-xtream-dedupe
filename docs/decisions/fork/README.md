# Fork decision records

This directory holds ADRs for decisions made in **this fork**
(`andyj682/emby-xtream-dedupe`) rather than upstream (`firestaerter3/emby-xtream`).

## Why the separate namespace

Both projects are actively adding ADRs, and both were allocating from the same
`001, 002, 003 …` sequence. That collides on every merge: upstream shipped
`016-dispatcharr-stats-codec-trust.md` while this fork already had an `016`, an `017`
and an `018`. Git never reports a conflict, because the filenames differ — the damage
is silent. A code comment that says `see ADR-016` stops naming one document.

So fork ADRs live here, in their own sequence, and are cited as **`ADR-F001`**,
`ADR-F002`, and so on. Upstream cannot collide with a directory it does not know
exists, and a bare `ADR-016` anywhere in the tree is unambiguously upstream's.

## Conventions

- Filenames are `NNN-kebab-case-title.md`, numbered from `001` in **this** directory.
- Cite them in code, docs and commit messages as `ADR-F001`, never as `ADR-001`.
- Upstream ADRs stay in `docs/decisions/` and keep their own numbers. Reference them
  by their plain number (`ADR-012`, `ADR-014`) exactly as upstream does.
- Never renumber an existing fork ADR. If one is superseded, add a new one and mark
  the old one `SUPERSEDED BY ADR-Fnnn`.

## History

These three were renumbered on 2026-09-07, during the merge that brought in upstream's
`4b81027..3482982`. They were previously ADR-016, ADR-017 and ADR-018. References
written before that date — in the CHANGELOG for releases 1.4.0 through 1.5.0, in commit
messages, and in git history generally — use the old numbers.

`009-publish-the-wanted-set.md` was renumbered from F008 during the 2026-10 merge of
`andyj682/main`. Both forks had independently allocated F008 — this tree shipped
`008-unreview-tombstones.md` on main first, so the incoming publish-the-wanted-set ADR
(older by authoring date, newer by arrival here) took the next number. References in
the incoming commits' messages still say F008 for it.
