> **This is a fork of [firestaerter3/emby-xtream](https://github.com/firestaerter3/emby-xtream).**
> It tracks upstream, adding a companion interface that de-duplicates titles across categories
> and tracks reviewed/unreviewed items to make processing large VOD libraries more efficient.
> It's currently most useful if you use Dispatcharr as your XC provider: Dispatcharr normalizes
> titles across providers before they reach Emby, giving movies a single stream ID and series
> an identical name across providers. Those are the two factors that drive this fork's
> de-duplication. While this approach is unlikely to help de-duplicate libraries imported
> directly from IPTV providers, the reviewed/unreviewed aspect of the companion interface will
> function regardless. Extending de-duplication to raw provider libraries is possible future
> work. Everything in the upstream README below still applies.

## What this fork adds

When a provider lists the same title under many categories, a simple per-category view means
reviewing the same movie or show multiple times. This fork adds a title-level review workflow
on top of the existing per-title exclusion:

- **De-duplicated review view** — one row per unique title across your selected categories
  (movies collapse by stream ID, series by name), so a title listed in five categories appears
  once. Search, filter by category, and exclude at the title level.
- **Reviewed checkpoint** — mark titles "reviewed" (a bookmark, separate from excluding), with
  segmented *Show* (All / Included / Excluded) and *Reviewed* (All / Reviewed / Unreviewed) view
  filters — pull up just your worklist (unreviewed), audit everything excluded, and so on. After an
  initial pass through your library, "unreviewed" doubles as "new since I last looked." Per-title
  and bulk.
- **Browse ⇄ De-duplicated review toggle** — switch between the classic per-category tree and
  the de-dup list; both edit the same exclusion list, so switching is lossless, and your choice
  is remembered.
- **Title-level series exclusion** — Dispatcharr gives the same show a distinct ID per category,
  so excluding it in one place can leave copies elsewhere. The sync applies your exclusions to a
  title's whole group of duplicate copies, not just the IDs you ticked, so a copy that appears
  later under a fresh ID is skipped without any action from you. This is based on the fact that Dispatcharr uses the exact same title for the series for every merged copy of it. Titles that Dispatcharr hasn't merged and have different names will appear as different items in the review interface.
- **Only sync movies and series you have reviewed** — normally anything you have not excluded gets
  synced, which is fine until a provider adds content in bulk. With this option on, a title is
  written only once you have reviewed it or excluded it, so new arrivals wait in the de-dup view
  instead of landing in your library.
  If a title already on disk reappears with a different ID it is automatically marked as reviewed
  and continues to sync. For series, an existing record of their episodes counts as recognition too,
  so a rename is fine as long as the ID is stable. Turning on **metadata IDs in folder names** makes
  this recognition considerably more reliable. If the reviewed-list setting is ever unreadable the
  option disables itself for that run and says so in the log, rather than treating every title as
  unreviewed and holding back your whole library.
- **Sync robustness for duplicates** — cross-listed series collapse to one folder instead of
  writing duplicate per-episode files, and series whose episode list returns empty under load are
  retried so a batch of new titles lands in one sync.

### Surviving a provider renumbering its catalog

Every exclusion and reviewed mark is stored against the provider's stream ID, and some providers
periodically reissue those in bulk. When that happens, thousands of decisions silently detach at
once: long-settled titles reappear as unreviewed, files pointing at dead IDs get cleaned up as
orphans, and nothing in any log explains it. This fork treats that as a first-class failure
rather than bad luck.

- **Decisions re-point themselves** — the plugin records each movie's TMDB ID alongside the
  decision, so a title returning under a new ID is recognised and your choice moves with it,
  during the ordinary sync. There is deliberately no button and no prompt: the defining property
  of this failure is that nothing tells you it happened, so anything needing you to notice has
  already failed. It protects decisions from the moment it is installed onward, needs the provider
  to supply a TMDB ID, and does not cover series, whose listing carries none.
- **The sync will not delete a folder it just wrote** — exclusions are stored per ID but enforced
  by folder name, so two catalog entries that resolve to one folder name used to make the sync
  write a title and then immediately delete it, on every run, leaving you with neither copy.
- **It keeps its own records, with no setup** — the store sizes in a log that does not rotate, a
  dated listing of which provider ID was which title, a rollback copy taken immediately before
  every configuration write, and a scheduled backup of the whole configuration. Point **Backup and
  records folder** at a different drive and the backup, the listings and the store-size log move
  there, which is what turns them from same-disk copies into real ones. The rollback stays beside
  the configuration on purpose: it is taken on every write, so it has to be somewhere always
  available.
- **Recovery scripts for what the plugin cannot reach** — damage that predates installation, series
  identity, and repairing a configuration after the fact. See
  [Diagnostics and recovery scripts](#diagnostics-and-recovery-scripts).

The in-plugin half exists because the alternative did not hold up in practice: tooling that needs
Docker, a cron entry and prior knowledge protects the people who least need protecting. A snapshot
is only useful if it was taken *before* the event, which means it cannot depend on anyone
remembering to take one.

## Related projects

This plugin is one of four small projects that together run a Dispatcharr-backed VOD library in
Emby. Each is useful on its own, but they were built to fit together, and one dependency is worth
stating plainly before you rely on this one.

- **[dispatcharr_vod_concurrency_fix](https://github.com/andyj682/dispatcharr_vod_concurrency_fix)**
  — coalesces the near-simultaneous range requests some clients (notably Emby) make when playing
  MKV VOD files, so they share one provider slot instead of failing over to a different file and
  corrupting playback.
- **[dispatcharr_vod_preferences](https://github.com/andyj682/dispatcharr_vod_preferences)**
  — control over which VOD stream Dispatcharr serves through its proxy for a given title, which
  clients cannot otherwise reach. Composable options to prefer better video or audio quality, or
  to remember a specific stream or provider.
- **[dispatcharr_vod_episode_sweep](https://github.com/andyj682/dispatcharr_vod_episode_sweep)**
  — learns which VOD series a client syncs, then once a day refreshes all of each watched show's
  provider and category relations, so new episodes stop going missing. Scoped to only the series
  you sync; runs in the background.
- **emby-xtream-dedupe** *(this repo)* — generates `.strm` files for Emby from a Dispatcharr
  catalog, de-duplicating titles cross-listed across categories and holding new arrivals for
  review before they reach your library.

### A `.strm` generator alone will not keep your episodes up to date

A `.strm` generator writes files for the episodes Dispatcharr already knows about. It does not —
and cannot — make Dispatcharr go and look for new ones. Dispatcharr refreshes a series' episode
data lazily, and nothing in a normal sync forces that refresh: a healthy, settled library makes no
episode-detail calls at all, precisely because nothing has changed from its point of view.

So without a server-side sweep, new episodes of shows you already have can simply never appear.
The library looks healthy, the syncs report success, and the missing episodes are invisible
because nothing ever asked for them.

[dispatcharr_vod_episode_sweep](https://github.com/andyj682/dispatcharr_vod_episode_sweep) exists
to close exactly that gap, and is designed to run alongside a `.strm` generator like this one. It
learns which series a client actually syncs, so it stays scoped to your library rather than
hammering the whole catalog, and refreshes every provider and category relation of each show
once a day. Any equivalent server-side refresh will do — the requirement is that *something*
periodically makes Dispatcharr re-check its providers for new episodes. If you run this plugin
without one, treat missing episodes as expected rather than as a bug here.

## Features

### Live TV & EPG

Full Live TV integration with Emby's native TV guide.

- **M3U playlist generation** with channel metadata, logos, and EPG channel IDs
- **XMLTV electronic program guide** with configurable fetch window (1-14 days)
- **Category-based filtering** — select which channel groups to include
- **Stream format selection** — MPEG-TS or HLS (M3U8)
- **Adult content filtering** — opt-in toggle for adult-flagged channels

- **Automatic caching** — M3U (15 min) and EPG (30 min) with thread-safe invalidation

### VOD Movie Library

Sync on-demand movies as STRM files that Emby treats as a native movie library.

- **STRM file generation** — one file per movie, Emby handles metadata and artwork
- **Folder organization modes:**
  - **Single folder** — all movies in one `Movies/` directory
  - **Multiple folders** — auto-organized by provider category name
  - **Custom mapping** — define your own folders and assign categories to each
- **TMDB metadata matching** — appends `[tmdbid=123]` to folder names for instant Emby identification
- **TMDB fallback lookup** — queries Emby's metadata providers when the Xtream source lacks a TMDB ID
- **Category selection** — pick specific VOD categories to sync, or sync all
- **Per-title selection** — expand any category (Single Folder mode) to tick individual movies. Unticked titles stop syncing and their folder is removed on the next sync, whether or not orphan cleanup is on
- **Danger zone** — one-click delete of all synced movie content

### TV Series Library

Full series support with proper season/episode structure.

- **Season/Episode STRM files** — `Show Name/Season 01/Show Name - S01E01 - Episode Title.strm`
- **Series detail fetching** — pulls episode lists per series from the Xtream API
- **TVDb / TMDB ID folder naming** — `Show Name [tvdbid=81189]` for reliable metadata matching
- **Manual ID overrides** — force a specific TVDb ID for shows that don't auto-match
- **Metadata fallback lookup** — searches Emby's providers when no ID is available
- **Same folder modes as movies** — single, multiple, or custom category mapping
- **Per-title selection** — same as movies, at whole-series granularity rather than per-episode

### Smart Sync Engine

Efficient sync that doesn't re-download what you already have.

- **Smart skip** — skips writing STRM files that already exist on disk
- **Configurable parallelism** — 1-10 concurrent operations (default 3)
- **Orphan cleanup** — automatically removes STRM files for content no longer in the source
- **Cross-listing deduplication** — movies/series appearing in multiple categories are synced once
- **Content name cleaning** — strips provider prefix tags (e.g. `|UK|`, `|FR|`) and custom terms from titles
- **Real-time progress** — Phase, Total, Completed, Skipped, Failed counters polled every 500ms

### Dispatcharr Integration

Optional integration with [Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) for IPTV stream management.

- **Stream proxy routing** — routes Live TV through Dispatcharr's proxy for connection management
- **Pre-populated media info** — fetches codec, resolution, and bitrate from Dispatcharr's stream stats (requires [Streamflow](https://github.com/krinkuto11/streamflow) configured in Dispatcharr to generate per-channel metadata)
- **FFprobe bypass** — skips Emby's stream analysis when stats are available (faster channel switching)
- **JWT authentication** — automatic token refresh with retry and exponential backoff
- **Graceful fallback** — reverts to direct Xtream URLs if Dispatcharr is unavailable

### Built-in Dashboard

A configuration UI embedded in Emby's plugin settings with five tabs.

- **Dashboard** — last sync status, sync history (last 10), library stats, live progress bar
- **Settings** — server connection, sync tuning, name cleaning, metadata matching
- **Movies** — enable/disable, folder mode, category selection with search, sync button
- **Series** — same layout as movies with series-specific options
- **Live TV** — stream format, EPG settings, catch-up, Dispatcharr, category filtering

## Installation

### Step 1: Download the Plugin

Download `Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll` from the [latest release](../../releases/latest). The same
file loads on Emby Server 4.9 and 4.10 (upstream ADR-017: the 4.9-SDK build resolves
AddConsumer/RemoveConsumer on 4.10 by name and signature).

> Only the single DLL file is needed — no other dependencies.

> Releases also carry `Emby.Xtream.Plugin-4.10.dll`. It is the same file under the name older
> 4.10 installs expect, so either one is fine.

<details>
<summary><strong>Build from source (alternative)</strong></summary>

Requires .NET SDK 6.0+:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andyj682/emby-xtream-dedupe.git
cd emby-xtream-dedupe
bash build-dedupe.sh
```

That builds **both** Emby targets, runs both test configurations, and checks the delete-site
guard — the same things CI does. The DLLs land at:

| Target | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Emby 4.9.x and 4.10 | `Emby.Xtream.Plugin/out/Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll` — this is the file releases ship |
| Emby 4.10 SDK (verification build) | `out_4_10/Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll` |

Since upstream's single-DLL change (ADR-017), the release asset for both Emby versions is the
4.9-SDK build from `out/`; the `out_4_10` build exists so the 4.10 SDK stays compiled and tested,
not because releases need a second file.

Expect the 4.10 test run to report **more** tests than the 4.9 one: a handful of them cover
methods that only exist in that build.

To build just the 4.9 target, `cd Emby.Xtream.Plugin && bash build.sh` still works.

</details>

### Step 2: Install the Plugin

Copy the DLL to your Emby Server's plugins directory and restart.

**Docker (most common):**
```bash
docker cp Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll emby:/config/plugins/
docker restart emby
```

**Bare metal (Linux):**
```bash
cp Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll /var/lib/emby/plugins/
systemctl restart emby-server
```

**Bare metal (macOS/Windows):**
Copy `Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll` to your Emby data directory under `plugins/`, then restart Emby Server.

### Step 3: Configure the Plugin

1. Open Emby's web UI
2. Go to **Settings > Plugins > Xtream Tuner**
3. Enter your Xtream server details:
   - **Server URL** — e.g. `http://your-provider:port`
   - **Username** and **Password**
4. Click **Test Connection** to verify
5. Click **Save**

### Step 4: Set Up Live TV

1. Switch to the **Live TV** tab
2. Choose your **Stream Format** (MPEG-TS recommended)
3. Click **Refresh Categories** to load channel groups
4. Select the categories you want
5. Configure **EPG** settings (days to fetch, cache duration)
6. Click **Save**
7. Go to **Emby Settings > Live TV** and add a new tuner:
   - Type: **Xtream Tuner**
   - It will auto-discover the plugin's M3U and EPG endpoints

### Step 5: Set Up Movies (Optional)

1. Switch to the **Movies** tab
2. Check **Enable VOD Movies**
3. Click **Refresh Categories** to load VOD categories
4. Choose a **Folder Organization** mode:
   - **Single Folder** — select categories, all movies go to `Movies/`
   - **Multiple Folders** — one folder per category, auto-named
   - **Custom** — click "Add Folder", name it, assign categories
5. Click **Sync Movies Now**
6. In Emby, add a new **Movies** library pointing to the STRM output path (default: `/config/xtream/Movies`)

### Step 6: Set Up Series (Optional)

1. Switch to the **Series** tab
2. Check **Enable Series / TV Shows**
3. Same workflow as Movies — refresh categories, select, choose folder mode
4. Click **Sync Series Now**
5. In Emby, add a new **TV Shows** library pointing to `/config/xtream/Shows`

### Step 7: Dispatcharr Integration (Optional)

If you use [Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) for stream management:

1. Go to **Live TV** tab > **Dispatcharr** section
2. Check **Enable Dispatcharr**
3. Enter Dispatcharr URL, username, and password
4. Click **Test Dispatcharr** to verify
5. Save — Live TV streams will now route through Dispatcharr's proxy

> **Note:** For the plugin to receive codec/resolution metadata and skip FFprobe, [Streamflow](https://github.com/krinkuto11/streamflow) must be enabled and configured in Dispatcharr. Without Streamflow generating per-channel stream stats, the plugin falls back to standard stream handling.

### Updating the Plugin

Download the latest DLL from [Releases](../../releases/latest), replace the file in your plugins directory, and restart Emby. Your configuration is preserved across updates.

If Emby Server moved to 4.10 while you were on plugin v1.4.97 or older, the plugin stops loading
with `Method 'AddConsumer' ... does not have an implementation`, so its own update button is not
available. Download `Emby.Xtream.Plugin.dll` from the latest release by hand once. After that,
updates work on both versions.

## Protecting your configuration

Your exclusions and reviewed marks are the expensive part of this plugin's state. On a curated
library that is tens of thousands of individual decisions, and nothing else on your system knows
what they were — a media scan cannot rebuild them.

**What the plugin does for you**, with no setup at all:

- **Store sizes in every sync log**, so a sudden drop is visible rather than something you notice
  weeks later when the review queue looks wrong — and appended to `counts.log` as well, because
  Emby's log rotates and the value of those counts is the trend.
- **The full list of deleted files** beside Emby's logs whenever a cleanup removes more than the
  log line samples.
- **A rollback copy** of the configuration into an `xtream-rollback` folder next to it, taken
  immediately before the plugin writes.
- **A scheduled backup** of the configuration, and a **dated catalog snapshot** written during each
  sync — both under the **Backup and records folder**, which defaults to `xtream-backups` beside
  the configuration.

**Putting one back.** Under **Restore a Saved Configuration** on the Settings tab, **Show saved
copies** lists every rollback and backup with the date it was taken and what restoring it would
change — "nothing", or something like "2 settings, +8,554 movie exclusions" — so you can tell them
apart without having to remember what was in them. Restoring replaces your whole configuration with
that copy — every setting, not only the exclusions and reviewed marks — and takes a rollback copy of
the current state first, so a restore can itself be undone. You start it; the plugin never restores
anything on its own.

A copy whose decision stores cannot be read is listed but refused, because restoring it would
replace a readable store with an unreadable one. Restoring is also refused while a sync is running,
since the sync would write its own results over it moments later.

**What it does not do.** By default all of that lives on the same disk as the file it protects. It
covers a bad write; it does not survive losing the volume. And if you point the backup folder at
another drive, note that the pointer lives in the configuration itself — so after losing the
configuration entirely, the plugin looks in the default location and will not find copies kept
elsewhere. Put them back by hand first, then restore.

**So point the backup folder at a different drive** if you have one — that single setting upgrades
the backups and snapshots from same-disk to real ones. For anything off-machine, the whole
configuration is still a single XML file:

```bash
cp /path/to/emby/config/plugins/configurations/Emby.Xtream.Plugin.xml ~/backups/$(date +%F).xml
```

> ⚠️ **That file — and every rollback copy — contains your provider username and password in
> plain text.** Keep the copies local, and never commit one to version control or attach one to a
> bug report.

## Diagnostics and recovery scripts

`scripts/` holds standalone Python tools for answering "what does my live data actually say"
without a rebuild or a deploy. They read the plugin's config XML and the provider's **list**
endpoints only — never `get_series_info`, which trips Dispatcharr's gated episode refresh — so
they are safe to run against a working setup. Nothing writes to the live config.

| Script | What it answers |
|---|---|
| `catalogue-snapshot.py` | Records which provider ID was which title, today, plus a census of how many stored IDs no longer exist. Run it periodically; the others consume its output |
| `audit-strm-links.py` | Which `.strm` files point at a stream ID the provider no longer has, split into "the title came back under a new ID" and "the content is gone" |
| `analyse-new-arrivals.py` | Given two snapshots, splits a batch of new arrivals into already-excluded / already-reviewed / already-on-disk / genuinely new — i.e. how much of a review queue is actually new work |
| `repair-id-churn.py` | Re-points exclusions and reviewed marks after a provider reassigns IDs. Dry run by default; `--write` emits a *candidate* config for you to diff and install yourself |
| `check-repair-safety.py` | Run before installing a `repair-id-churn.py` candidate: would any proposed exclusion land on a title that is currently on disk? Checks both the stream ID and the folder name, because exclusion is stored per ID but enforced per name |
| `config-counts-canary.py` | How many exclusions and reviewed marks does a config actually contain? Works on the live config, a test rig's, or a repair candidate. Distinguishes "empty" from "unreadable", which look identical in a count and mean opposite things |
| `find-crosslisted-series.py` | Finds a cross-listed series, reports titles that are only partly excluded, and can emit a minimal test config |
| `xtream_catalogue.py` | Shared helpers (not run directly) |

`config-counts-canary.py` is worth running on a schedule with `--log`: the four counts only mean
something as a trend, and a silent drop is the failure you most want to catch early. It exits
non-zero when a store is unreadable, so it works as a cron alarm.

They assume Docker and a throwaway `python:3-alpine` container, e.g.:

```bash
docker run --rm --network container:emby --memory=512m \
  -v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro \
  -v /path/to/emby/config:/cfg:ro \
  -v "$PWD/scripts":/scripts:ro \
  -v "$HOME/xtream-snapshots":/out \
  python:3-alpine python3 /scripts/catalogue-snapshot.py --out /out
```

`--network container:emby` matters if your Xtream base URL is a hostname on a Docker network —
the default bridge cannot resolve it, and the failure looks like a DNS error rather than a
credentials problem. Note also that snapshots contain titles, and the config XML they read
contains your provider credentials in plaintext (see below), so keep both local.

`-v /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro` matters more than it looks. These scripts stamp dated
filenames and log lines with the **container's** local time, and a bare `python:3-alpine` has no
timezone set, so it runs in UTC — while Emby, and therefore the plugin's own records, use whatever
timezone that container was given. Without the mount the two disagree by your UTC offset: a
snapshot taken in the evening can land under tomorrow's date, and a counts log interleaved with the
plugin's own would run backwards. Mounting the host clock makes every record agree, and it needs no
`tzdata` package.

---

## Security Note: Credentials in STRM Files and M3U Output

The Xtream Codes protocol requires the username and password to appear directly in every stream URL — there is no token or session form. As a result, your Xtream credentials end up embedded in plaintext in two places:

- The `.strm` files written under your **STRM Library Path** (default `/config/xtream`)
- The M3U playlist served by the plugin's tuner endpoint

This is a property of the protocol, not a plugin defect — the same is true of any Xtream-based tooling. Anything that can read those files (other containers sharing the volume, backup tools, indexers, users with shell access on the host) can harvest the credentials.

**How to keep credentials off disk:**

- **Use Dispatcharr.** When [Dispatcharr](https://github.com/Dispatcharr/Dispatcharr) is enabled, Live TV and multi-provider VOD URLs route through Dispatcharr's credential-free proxy URLs (`/proxy/ts/stream/<uuid>`, `/proxy/vod/movie/<uuid>`) instead of the raw Xtream form. Single-provider VOD movies and series episodes still fall back to the Xtream URL today.
- **Restrict filesystem permissions.** Make sure the STRM library path is not readable by other users or containers on the host. For Docker, avoid mounting `/config/xtream` into unrelated services.
- **Use a dedicated provider account.** If your Xtream provider supports multiple credential sets per subscription, use a separate one for Emby so it can be rotated independently.

If credential exposure on disk is unacceptable for your environment, Dispatcharr in front of the plugin is currently the only complete answer. Improving credential-free routing for single-provider VOD and series episodes is tracked as a future enhancement.
